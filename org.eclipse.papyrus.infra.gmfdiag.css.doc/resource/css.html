	<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
	<p>The standard UML specification provides a few hints to represent
		graphical elements. However, it only focuses on the general
		representation of these elements (e.g. A Class is a rectangle, with
		optional compartments for its attributes and operations, and its name
		should be displayed in italic if the Class is abstract).</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, for a better readability (and even esthetic), the
		user has a certain freedom for changing some graphical properties,
		such as an Element’s color. Until now, in Papyrus, this customization
		could be done by two complement means:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Appearance tab (Properties view): change the appearance of
			the selected element(s)</li>
		<li>Preferences page: change the initial appearance of all newly
			created element(s)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>While this allows defining a custom theme for our diagrams, this
		mechanism suffers from a few limitations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is not possible to create different categories of
			appearance for the same semantic Element (e.g. “Blue Class” and
			“Green class”). We’d have to create “Blue classes” and change some of
			them to “Green” manually.</li>
		<li>If we wanted to change the current theme, we’d have either to
			change each object’s appearance one by one, or to write an automatic
			transformation, which could be really complicated.</li>
		<li>It is not easy to export a Theme, as they are stored in the
			Eclipse preferences. It is almost impossible to ship a ready-to-use
			distribution of Papyrus with a custom theme.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The release of Eclipse 4 Juno this summer gave us the opportunity to
		rely on their CSS Engine to support Cascading StyleSheets in Papyrus
		diagrams. Just like in web pages, the CSS format is used to separate
		the contents of our diagrams from their appearance. It becomes
		possible to change the appearance of a whole diagram, or even a set of
		diagrams, independently of the number of represented elements, in a
		single click.<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Installation">Installation</h1>
	<p>The CSS Stylesheet support is not shipped in the base
		installation of Papyrus. However, it can be easily installed from the
		Papyrus discovery site. Select “Help”, “Install Papyrus Additional
		Components”, and check “Diagram Stylesheets”.</p>
	<p>
		<img title="Installation" alt="Installation" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_Installation.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>Press finish, restart Eclipse, and that's it.</p>
	<p>Your diagrams should now look like the following:</p>
	<p>
		<img title="Papyrus diagram without CSS Theme"
			alt="Papyrus diagram without CSS Theme" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_no_theme.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
		<img title="Papyrus Diagram with CSS Theme"
			alt="Papyrus Diagram with CSS Theme" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_theme.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>Note: If you opened a diagram which has been created without the
		CSS Support, it may still have a custom appearance, e.g. without
		Element icons. This might or might not be a problem, as this may
		conflict with the CSS Theme. You can reset all custom appearances by
		pressing the “Default style” button in the Style tab of the Diagram’s
		properties view.</p>
	<h1 id="Using_StyleSheets">Using StyleSheets</h1>
	<p>
		To define a custom style, the first step is to create a Stylesheet.
		The creation is really straightforward: a Stylesheet is a text file
		with the .css extension. You can create such a file using the “New
		&gt; File” wizard.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, you need to associate this file with your diagram. Select a
		diagram, and then go to the Style tab of the properties view, and add
		a new “Diagram style sheet”. There isn’t currently any style sheet
		available from the diagram, so you need to create a new “Stylesheet
		reference”.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		<img title="Import stylesheet in Papyrus"
			alt="Import stylesheet in Papyrus" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_Import_stylesheet.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
		Browse your workspace to find your css file, and then validate. Your
		stylesheet is now associated to your diagram.<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Editing_a_StyleSheet">Editing a StyleSheet</h1>
	<p>
		Papyrus Stylesheets are stored in text files with the “.css” extension
		(e.g. stylesheet.css).<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="Manually:_The_CSS_Syntax">Manually: The CSS Syntax</h2>
	<h3 id="Syntax_elements">Syntax elements</h3>
	<p>
		The CSS syntax is a list of rules, which associates selectors and
		properties.<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The selector: describes the condition which has to be
			fulfilled for a rule to be applied<br />
		</li>
		<li>The properties: describes the appearance of the elements
			matching the rule<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Eclipse implements the 2.1 version of the CSS syntax. The available
		selectors are:<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>*</b>: Matches all elements<br /></li>
		<li><b>ElementType</b>: Matches the elements of type
			“ElementType”<br /></li>
		<li><b>.myStyle</b>: Matches the elements on which the style
			“myStyle” is applied<br /></li>
		<li><b>#myID</b>: Matches the element with the CSS ID “myID”. The
			CSS ID must be unique among a diagram. To avoid confusing the users,
			and because this selector doesn’t make much sense on diagrams, this
			selector has been disabled in Papyrus.<br />
		</li>
		<li><b>[property=value]</b>: Matches the
			elements which have a property “property” with the value “value”. It
			can also match the properties of Stereotypes<br /></li>
		<li><b>[appliedStereotypes~=&quot;MyStereotype&quot;]</b>:
			Matches the elements on which the Stereotype "MyStereotype" is
			applied. You can use either the Stereotype's name or qualified name
			(MyProfile::MyPackage::MyStereotype). Note: always use the "~="
			operator (Which means "contains"), because elements can have more
			than one applied stereotype.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The pseudo-selectors are currently not used in Papyrus.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		These selectors can be combined using one of the following
		combinators:<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Selector1 Selector2</b>: Descendant selector. Matches the
			elements which match Selector2 and are contained in an element
			matching Selector1<br /></li>
		<li><b>Selector1 &gt; Selector2</b>: Child selector. Matches the
			elements which match Selector2 and are directly contained in an
			element matching Selector2<br /></li>
		<li><b>Selector1 + Selector2</b>: Sibling selector. Matches the
			elements which match Selector2 and are immediately preceded by a
			Sibling element which match Selector1.<br /></li>
		<li><b>Selector1, Selector2</b>: Alternative selector. Matches
			elements matching either Selector1 or Selector2<br /></li>
	</ul>
	<p>A rule also contains a list of properties, in the form
		property:value;</p>
	<p>
		In Papyrus, the selectors apply to semantic elements and properties
		(i.e. UML Elements), and the properties apply to the appearance
		properties (i.e. GMF Appearance properties). A few custom properties
		(Independent from the GMF Appearance model) are also available.<br />
	</p>
	<h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3>
	<pre class="source-css">* {
	fillColor: red;
	fontColor: #0000FF;
}
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		Meaning: all elements should be filled in red, and all texts should be
		blue (RGB Color #0000FF)<br />
	</p>
	<pre class="source-css">Class {
	gradient: white vertical;
	elementIcon:true;
	shadow:true;
	qualifiedNameDepth:full;
}
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		Meaning: this style applies to all UML Classes. They will have a white
		and vertical gradient. The Element icon and the shadow will be
		displayed, as well as their fully qualified name.<br />
	</p>
	<pre class="source-css">ClassDiagram Class&gt;Property {
	fontColor: red;
}
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		Meaning: The properties directly contained in a Class, which is drawn
		on a ClassDiagram (Either as a root element of the diagram, or in a
		Package) will be displayed in red.<br />
	</p>
	<pre class="source-css">[appliedStereotypes~="Block"]{
	bold:true;
}

/* Equivalent: qualified name */
[appliedStereotypes~="SysML::Blocks::Block"]{
	bold:true;
}
</pre>
	<p>Meaning: The elements with the "Block" stereotype must be
		displayed in bold.</p>
	<pre class="source-css">[appliedStereotypes~=Block][isEncapsulated=true]{
	fontColor:red;
}
</pre>
	<p>Meaning: The elements with the "Block" stereotype, and the
		stereotype property "isEncapsulated" set to true, must be displayed in
		red.</p>
	<h2 id="With_the_Papyrus_tooling">With the Papyrus tooling</h2>
	<p>Papyrus also provides a tool to generate a CSS Rule from an
		element displayed in the diagram. You need to create a stylesheet
		before you can edit it with the Create style tool, and it is
		recommended (Although not required) to associate this style sheet with
		your current diagram.</p>
	<p>
		To use it, create an element and change its appearance via the
		“Appearance” tab of the properties view. Then, right click on the
		element, and select “Format”, “Create a new style”. The dialog box
		contains three tabs:<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conditions: The conditions under which the style will be
			applied (Corresponds to the “CSS Selectors”)</li>
		<li>Properties: The graphical properties to export to the style
			sheet</li>
		<li>Stylesheet: The style sheet to edit<br /></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<img title="Create style dialog" alt="Create style dialog" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_Export_style.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Stylesheet tab, select your stylesheet:<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have already associated the style sheet to your
			diagram, you can use the “Applies stylesheet” button.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, you need to select “External stylesheet”, and
			browse your workspace to retrieve the file. Note that in this case,
			as the edited stylesheet might not be applied to your diagram, you
			won’t be able to see the changes in the current diagram.<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In the conditions tab, there are three groups of options:<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The kind of element to which the style applies (e.g. the
			style will be applied to “Class” elements, or to any kind of
			elements). It can be restricted to a specific diagram.</li>
		<li>You can add restrictions on the current value(s) of the
			element (e.g. the style will be applied to concrete classes). Only
			primitive type and enumerated attributes are supported here.</li>
		<li>The style name is used to apply a style manually.<br /></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The properties tab contains all the graphical properties that can be
		applied to the selected object. It is used to choose the graphical
		properties to apply on the objects matching the conditions.<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Supported_properties">Supported properties</h1>
	<h2 id="Selector_properties">Selector properties</h2>
	<p>Selector properties are semantic element properties. They can be
		used with one of the following syntaxes:</p>
	<p>
		<b>[isAbstract=true]</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Class[isAbstract=true]</b>
	</p>
	<p>The supported semantic element properties are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strings: <b>[name=MyName]</b>, <b>[name="My name"]</b> (Quotes are required for complex
			Strings)<br /></li>
		<li>Integers: <b>[size="12"]</b>
			(Quotes are required) <br /></li>
		<li>Booleans: <b>[isAbstract=true]</b>
			(Quotes are optional)<br /></li>
		<li>Enumerations: <b>[visibility=visible]</b>
			(Quotes are optional)&lt;br /&gt;
		</li>
		<li>References to named elements (UML NamedElement or Ecore
			ENamedElement): <b>[type=String]</b><br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some selectors can also be used to represent some specific parts
		of an element. For example, it is possible to hide a specific
		compartment:</p>
	<pre class="source-css">Class &gt; Compartment[kind="attribute"] {
	visible:false;
}

Class &gt; Compartment[kind="symbol"] {
	visible:true;
}

Compartment[kind="structure"]{
	collapsed:true;
}

</pre>
	<h2 id="Style_properties">Style properties</h2>
	<p>
		Style properties are graphical properties supported by the display.
		Note that some graphical elements may not support some specific
		properties (Either because they shouldn't support them, or because
		they are not yet implemented). For example, a UML::Class will not
		support the <i>italic</i> property, because in UML, <i>italic</i>
		means <i>abstract</i>.
	</p>
	<p>The CSS Supports all GMF Notation properties, as well as a few
		Papyrus-specific properties. This chapter will only list all the
		Papyrus-specific properties.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to discover new style properties is to use the
		Appearance tab of the Properties view in Papyrus. When hovering one of
		the appearance properties, the tooltip indicates the name of the
		corresponding CSS property</p>
	<p>
		<img title="CSS Property in tooltip" alt="CSS Property in tooltip"
			border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_tooltip.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>The following custom properties are supported:</p>
	<p>
		displayBorder: true | false<br /> displayName: true | false<br />
		maintainSymbolRatio: true | false<br /> <br /> elementIcon: true |
		false<br /> shadow: true | false<br /> <br /> qualifiedNameDepth: full
		| none | [int]<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Manipulating_styles">Manipulating styles</h1>
	<p>The computed styles will be applied automatically. For example,
		if your stylesheet tells that all your abstract classes must be red,
		the classes color will change automatically according to the value of
		their “isAbstract” property.</p>
	<p>
		In some other cases, however, you may want to specify manually the
		style that should be applied to your objects. For this case, you can
		use the “Applied styles” property in the “Style” tab of the properties
		view.<br />
	</p>
	<pre class="source-css">.myOwnStyle {
	fillColor: #A6C198;
	gradient:white horizontal;
}
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		<img title="Result" alt="Result" border="0"
			src="Papyrus_CSS_CustomStyle.png" /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
		Once a style is applied on an object, the object will be refreshed
		each time the style definition changes. For example, changing the
		style “myOwnStyle” to the following declaration:<br />
	</p>
	<pre class="source-css">.myOwnStyle {
	 fillColor: #E3A49C;
	 gradient: #FFFFFF horizontal;
}
</pre>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		All the green classes will become red.<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Deploying_a_CSS_Theme">Deploying a CSS Theme</h1>
	<p>Once you have defined your style sheet, you may want to export
		it to create a new theme (Or to extend an existing theme). To do so,
		Papyrus provides an extension point:
		org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.theme.</p>
	<p>This extension point needs two entries: a Theme Definition (ID,
		Label and icon of the Theme), and Theme contributions (A set of style
		sheets which will compose the Theme). More than one plug-in can
		contribute to the same Theme, which makes it possible to extend a
		Theme.</p>
	<p>
		The Theme can be modified from the Papyrus preferences page “CSS
		Theme”. Only one theme can be activated at the same time. A Theme
		applies to all Papyrus Diagrams from the workspace.<br />
	</p>
	<h1 id="Limitations_and_issues">Limitations and issues</h1>
	<p>
		There are currently a few identified limitations to the Stylesheet
		framework, as well as a few minor bugs.<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="Selectors">Selectors</h2>
	<p>
		Currently, some complex selectors are not supported in the Papyrus
		stylesheets.<br />
	</p>
	<h3 id="Selector_inheritance">Selector inheritance</h3>
	<p>
		It is not possible to apply a style to all descendant of a given
		Metaclass. For example, a Behavior will not inherit styles from a
		Class, although a Behavior actually is a Class.<br />
	</p>
	<h3 id="Labels">Labels</h3>
	<p>It is currently not possible to customize labels from the
		Stylesheets (e.g. show/hide type for all properties).</p>
	<h3 id="Events_support">Events support</h3>
	<p>
		Selectors based on user events are not yet implemented. For example,
		the CSS specification defines the&nbsp;:hover pseudo-selector to
		represent an element hovered by the mouse, which is not yet supported
		in Papyrus.<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="Stylesheets">Stylesheets</h2>
	<h3 id="Model_stylesheets">Model stylesheets</h3>
	<p>
		Currently, stylesheets can only be applied to a Diagram. It is not yet
		possible to apply a stylesheet on a Model or a Project.<br />
	</p>
	<h3 id="Workspace_stylesheets">Workspace stylesheets</h3>
	<p>
		The only way to define a workspace theme is through the use of a
		plug-in which defines a new extension. It is not yet possible to
		create a new local theme from the preferences page.<br />
	</p>
	<h2 id="Bugs">Bugs</h2>
	<p>
		The following bugs have been identified:<br />
